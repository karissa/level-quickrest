# Installation
This module is installed via npm:

```bash
$ npm install quickrest-level
```

## Usage


### Basic example

```js
var debug = require('debug')('models');
var Models = require('level-orm');
var level = require('level-prebuilt');
var util = require('util');
var bytewise = require('bytewise/hex');

var QuickRestLevel = require('quickrest-level')

var db = level(dbPath,
  {
    keyEncoding: bytewise,
    valueEncoding: 'json'
  }
);

var levelBook = new QuickRestLevel(db, 'book', 'id');
```

### Create a server

```js
var QuickRest = require('quickrest')

// Wire up API endpoints
router.addRoute('/api/book/id?', function(req, res) {
  var id = ... // get id here
  QuickRest.dispatch(levelBook, req, res, id, function (err, data) {
    res.end(JSON.stringify(data))
  })
})
```

#### Compound Keys and Shared Containers
A ```QuickRestLevel``` instance extends from [eugeneware/level-orm](https://github.com/eugeneware/level-orm), which has examples of Compound Keys and Shared Containers and it can be used in an identical fashion.
